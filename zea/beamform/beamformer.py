    .. dropdown:: Explanation

        The IQ data is related to the RF data as follows:

        .. math::

            x(t) &= I(t)\\cos(\\omega_c t) + Q(t)\\cos(\\omega_c t + \\pi/2)\\\\
            &= I(t)\\cos(\\omega_c t) - Q(t)\\sin(\\omega_c t)


        If we want to delay the RF data `x(t)` by `Δt` we can substitute in
        :math:`t=t+\\Delta t`. We also define :math:`I'(t) = I(t + \\Delta t)`,
        :math:`Q'(t) = Q(t + \\Delta t)`, and :math:`\\theta=\\omega_c\\Delta t`.
        This gives us:

        .. math::

            x(t + \\Delta t) &= I'(t) \\cos(\\omega_c (t + \\Delta t)) 
            - Q'(t) \\sin(\\omega_c (t + \\Delta t))\\\\
            &=  \\overbrace{(I'(t)\\cos(\\theta)
            - Q'(t)\\sin(\\theta) )}^{I_\\Delta(t)} \\cos(\\omega_c t)\\\\
            &- \\overbrace{(Q'(t)\\cos(\\theta)
            + I'(t)\\sin(\\theta))}^{Q_\\Delta(t)} \\sin(\\omega_c t)

        This means that to correctly interpolate the IQ data to the new components
        :math:`I_\\Delta(t)` and :math:`Q_\\Delta(t)`, it is not sufficient to just
        interpolate the I- and Q-channels independently. We also need to rotate the
        I- and Q-channels by the angle :math:`\\theta`. This function performs this
        rotation.

        f_number (int): The receive f-number. Set to zero to not use masking and
            return 1. (The f-number is the  ratio between distance from the transducer
            and the size of the aperture below which transducer elements contribute to
            the signal for a pixel.).
        fnum_window_fn (callable): F-number function to define the transition from
            straight in front of the element (fn(0.0)) to the largest angle within the f-number cone
            (fn(1.0)). The function should be zero for fn(x>1.0).


    Returns:
        Tensor: Mask of shape `(n_pix, n_el, 1)`
